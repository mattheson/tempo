# Test Assets

TODO

The `audio` and `ableton` directories hold audio files and Ableton projects used in Tempo's tests.
Files in this directory should not be referenced anywhere outside of `tests.rs`.

All Ableton projects and audio files found in `ableton` and `audio` respectively will be used in tests.
No test files are included as of now, but some will be in the future.
