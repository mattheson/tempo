## Current Status
**I am currently not working on Tempo**. My focus has shifted to some other projects.

**I promise to revisit Tempo in the future!** I'm not sure when, but the project is still exciting and I think there's potential for it. I have some interesting ideas for a future direction for Tempo.

The alpha version is usable and I encourage you to try it out!

If you're interested in contributing feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for showing interest in my project.
