# Tempo 
[website/manual](https://mattheson.github.io/tempo/)

Refined collaboration and version management for Ableton.
Go to "Releases" to download.

*macOS is only supported as of now! Windows support is coming soon...*

## Current Status
My current focus is on a big rewrite of Tempo in the `beta` branch.

I have exciting ideas for what the beta version will look like :)

I hope to have it working around March 2025.

Alpha version is usable and I can address issues in it as needed.
